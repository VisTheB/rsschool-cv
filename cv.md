## Briefly about myself:
I've been studying frontend-development since i was 16. I'm almost 17 now and i'm still in the process. In a little less than a year i will enroll in a technical university and maybe find an internship on some company or do freelancing. 

Since at this age i don't have a permanent source of money yet, i try to look for free sources of information and study all the material on my own. Various websites (most often: documentations, MDN and learn.javascript), youtube and telegram channels, roadmaps and events of different companies help me in this. 

Speaking about my personal qualities i can note that since school days i've been taking a responsible approach to tasks without shifting work to others; if it's necessary, can establish communication with a person and i also don't ger involved in conflicts first.

## Code example:
Given the angle (in degrees) of the hour-hand, return the time in 12 hour HH:MM format. Round down to the nearest minute.

```
let whatTimeIsIt = function(angle) {

let hour = Math.floor(angle/30), minutes = Math.floor((angle%30)*2);

if (hour < 10){hour = "0"+ hour;}
if (hour <= 0){hour = 12;}
if (minutes < 10){minutes = "0" + minutes;}

  return hour + ":" + minutes;
}
